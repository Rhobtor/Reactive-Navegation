[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmoveit_setup_framework.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "moveit_setup_framework", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_setup_framework" with any of the following names:

    moveit_setup_frameworkConfig.cmake
    moveit_setup_framework-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_setup_framework" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "moveit_setup_framework_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "moveit_setup_framework" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
